This website would document my learning journey for the course *ECON145 Introduction to Data Analytics in Healthcare*, conducted by Dr. Sean Lam. Health-related data may be derived from patients, hospitals, insurance companies, households, and government entities. The key objectives I hope to attain by the end of the course are:

-   Having a fundamental understanding of applying statistical concepts, visualisation, and commonly-used data mining techniques to address healthcare issues;

-   Develop data-driven solutions while learning how analytic problems in the industry are formed;

-   Equipped with analytical tools to uncover data insights; and

-   Manage healthcare data and support healthcare organisations in designing evidence-based solutions.
